< WHO IS THI ? >

THI is for anyone who wants to be a part of it. So far, this is just me, but I hope to expand this as rapidly as possible ( without compromising on the safety of this project however. )

From a more esoteric place, THI is an active exercise in decentralizing Self, and filling in with a centralized sense of interviduality.

For example, in my headspace, I define ‘Me’ in terms of the first and second degrees in my social network of life experience. So if a friend of my friend dies, I feel that too. If a friend of a friend need’s help, I consider helping.

I just wanna do awesome epic shit with my people, until we either die, or the cows decide to come home. ( We’ll come home too, take a little nap, rinse, repeat. ;)
